# testsponge
Ermm am basically a beginner i mean yeah i just started learning java I din't finish reading the whole book btw :D. So am just testing out the SpongeAPI with Gradle.
I coded a Spigot plugin already and it was kind of fun and easy..
Sponge is kinda complex but love it! Better than the bukkit family :D
